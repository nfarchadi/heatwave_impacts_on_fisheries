# Overview

This repository contains code to:

1) Download publicly available historical sea surface temperature data from OISST and characterize Marine Heatwave (MHW) properties (intensity, size, duration).

2) Developing vessel distribution models (downloading environmental data from HYCOM, fitting boosted regression trees, model validation, and prediction) and classifying core fishing grounds

3) Measure fleet responses to marine heatwaves: change in core fishing area and fleet displacement.

Majority of the code is spilt between the U.S. Atlantic longline fishery in the northwest Atlantic (NWA_PLL) and the U.S. Pacific troll fishery in the northeast Pacific (NEP_TROLL).
